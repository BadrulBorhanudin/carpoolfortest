## Title
CarPoolHub

## Description
This project uses everything Iâ€™ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.

## About the Project
CarPoolHub simplifies ride-sharing, allowing you to effortlessly find or offer rides with just a few taps. By sharing rides, we can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to less traffic, lower emissions, and substantial savings on fuel costs.
